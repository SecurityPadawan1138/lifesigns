# lifesigns
The basic concept for this project is you start the Python script, put the ip address or site name you want to watch and let it run.  It pings the address and logs if it connects or not.  

Settings:  I might put in delay prompt so you can change how often it pings with a low time check to help prevent DOS.

Logging:  It'll be a SQLLITE database that I'll make a few easy to read reports or time range.
